## Probability and Random Variables
- Probability
Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses how probable an event is. 
Probability =  number of positive outcomes (that lead to the event) / total number of outcomes

- random variables

- sample space.

- random variable can be discrete or continuous 

## Probability Distribution
- uniform distribution
It is discrete distribution 
in a sample space of N elements, each element equal probability of 1/N.


probability density function

- normal distribution

Mean

standard deviation

variance

Median: a value such that half of data points are lower than it, and another half higher
