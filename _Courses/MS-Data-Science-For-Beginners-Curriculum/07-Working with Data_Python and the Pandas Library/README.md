# Working with Data: Python and the Pandas Library

https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/blob/main/2-Working-With-Data/07-python/README.md


- Pandas allows you manipulate Dataframes, which are analogous to relational tables. 

- Numpy is a library for working with tensors, i.e. multi-dimensional arrays

- Matplotlib is a library used for data visualization and plotting graphs

- SciPy is a library with some additional scientific functions (probability and statistics)

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import ... # you need to specify exact sub-packages that you need
```
