# Defining Data Science

## What is Data Science
- The main goal of data science is to extract knowledge from data
- Data science uses scientific methods, such as probability and statistics.
- Obtained knowledge should be applied to produce some actionable insights
- We should be able to operate on both structured and unstructured data.
- Application domain is an important concept, and data scientists often need at least some degree of expertise in the problem domain, for example: finance, medicine, marketing, etc.

Another important aspect of Data Science is that it studies how data can be gathered, stored and operated upon using computers. While statistics gives us mathematical foundations, data science applies mathematical concepts to actually draw insights from data.


One of the ways to look at the data science is to consider it to be a separate paradigm of science:

- Empirical, in which we rely mostly on observations and results of experiments
- Theoretical, where new concepts emerge from existing scientific knowledge
- Computational, where we discover new principles based on some computational experiments
- Data-Driven, based on discovering relationships and patterns in the data


## Other Related Fields
- Database

- Big data : Often we need to store and process very large quantities of data with a relatively simple structure. There are special approaches and tools to store that data in a distributed manner on a computer cluster, and process it efficiently.

- Machine Learning : build a model that will be able to predict a desired outcome.

- AI:  building high complexity models that mimic human thought processes

- Visualization: make more sense of the data


## What you can do with Data
- Data Acquisition
- Data Storage
- Data Processing
- Visualization
- Training a predictive model
